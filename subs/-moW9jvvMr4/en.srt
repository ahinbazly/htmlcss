1
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,616
When I was first learning to meditate,

2
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,696
the instruction was to simply
pay attention to my breath,

3
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,800
and when my mind wandered,
to bring it back.

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,000
Sounded simple enough.

5
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,896
Yet I'd sit on these silent retreats,

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,256
sweating through T-shirts
in the middle of winter.

7
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,616
I'd take naps every chance I got
because it was really hard work.

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,640
Actually, it was exhausting.

9
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,136
The instruction was simple enough

10
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,280
but I was missing something
really important.

11
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,560
So why is it so hard to pay attention?

12
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,536
Well, studies show

13
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,736
that even when we're really
trying to pay attention to something --

14
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,336
like maybe this talk --

15
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,576
at some point,

16
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,936
about half of us
will drift off into a daydream,

17
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,040
or have this urge
to check our Twitter feed.

18
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,880
So what's going on here?

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,456
It turns out that we're fighting one
of the most evolutionarily-conserved

20
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,336
learning processes
currently known in science,

21
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,576
one that's conserved

22
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,040
back to the most basic
nervous systems known to man.

23
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,496
This reward-based learning process

24
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,696
is called positive
and negative reinforcement,

25
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,280
and basically goes like this.

26
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,896
We see some food that looks good,

27
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,616
our brain says, "Calories! ... Survival!"

28
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,136
We eat the food, we taste it --

29
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,376
it tastes good.

30
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,936
And especially with sugar,

31
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,216
our bodies send a signal
to our brain that says,

32
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,720
"Remember what you're eating
and where you found it."

33
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,016
We lay down this context-dependent memory

34
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,496
and learn to repeat the process next time.

35
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,736
See food,

36
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,456
eat food, feel good,

37
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,936
repeat.

38
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,576
Trigger, behavior, reward.

39
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,800
Simple, right?

40
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,056
Well, after a while,
our creative brains say,

41
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,296
"You know what?

42
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,936
You can use this for more
than just remembering where food is.

43
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,136
You know, next time you feel bad,

44
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,600
why don't you try eating
something good so you'll feel better?"

45
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,736
We thank our brains for the great idea,

46
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,336
try this and quickly learn

47
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,656
that if we eat chocolate or ice cream
when we're mad or sad,

48
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,880
we feel better.

49
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,016
Same process,

50
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,776
just a different trigger.

51
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,896
Instead of this hunger signal
coming from our stomach,

52
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,896
this emotional signal -- feeling sad --

53
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,200
triggers that urge to eat.

54
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,560
Maybe in our teenage years,

55
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:22,600
we were a nerd at school,

56
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,296
and we see those rebel kids
outside smoking and we think,

57
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,576
"Hey, I want to be cool."

58
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,800
So we start smoking.

59
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,536
The Marlboro Man wasn't a dork,
and that was no accident.

60
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,776
See cool,

61
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,096
smoke to be cool,

62
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,936
feel good. Repeat.

63
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,960
Trigger, behavior, reward.

64
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,896
And each time we do this,

65
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,936
we learn to repeat the process

66
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,200
and it becomes a habit.

67
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,216
So later,

68
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,856
feeling stressed out triggers
that urge to smoke a cigarette

69
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,280
or to eat something sweet.

70
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,136
Now, with these same brain processes,

71
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,056
we've gone from learning to survive

72
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,936
to literally killing ourselves
with these habits.

73
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,216
Obesity and smoking

74
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:06,520
are among the leading preventable causes
of morbidity and mortality in the world.

75
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,880
So back to my breath.

76
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,096
What if instead of fighting our brains,

77
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,656
or trying to force ourselves
to pay attention,

78
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,696
we instead tapped into this natural,
reward-based learning process ...

79
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,920
but added a twist?

80
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,576
What if instead we just got really curious

81
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,096
about what was happening
in our momentary experience?

82
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,656
I'll give you an example.

83
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,896
In my lab,

84
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,256
we studied whether mindfulness training
could help people quit smoking.

85
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,936
Now, just like trying to force myself
to pay attention to my breath,

86
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,216
they could try to force
themselves to quit smoking.

87
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,176
And the majority of them
had tried this before and failed --

88
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,120
on average, six times.

89
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,456
Now, with mindfulness training,

90
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,800
we dropped the bit about forcing
and instead focused on being curious.

91
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,816
In fact, we even told them to smoke.

92
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,816
What? Yeah, we said, "Go ahead and smoke,

93
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,376
just be really curious
about what it's like when you do."

94
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,096
And what did they notice?

95
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,816
Well here's an example
from one of our smokers.

96
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,576
She said, "Mindful smoking:

97
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,216
smells like stinky cheese

98
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,856
and tastes like chemicals,

99
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,080
YUCK!"

100
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,056
Now, she knew, cognitively
that smoking was bad for her,

101
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,960
that's why she joined our program.

102
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,216
What she discovered just by being
curiously aware when she smoked

103
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,376
was that smoking tastes like shit.

104
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,080
(Laughter)

105
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:30,375
Now, she moved from knowledge to wisdom.

106
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:33,495
She moved from knowing in her head
that smoking was bad for her

107
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:35,976
to knowing it in her bones,

108
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,296
and the spell of smoking was broken.

109
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,680
She started to become
disenchanted with her behavior.

110
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,056
Now, the prefrontal cortex,

111
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,616
that youngest part of our brain
from an evolutionary perspective,

112
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:52,696
it understands on an intellectual level
that we shouldn't smoke.

113
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,536
And it tries its hardest
to help us change our behavior,

114
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,896
to help us stop smoking,

115
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:02,040
to help us stop eating that second,
that third, that fourth cookie.

116
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,456
We call this cognitive control.

117
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,280
We're using cognition
to control our behavior.

118
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,176
Unfortunately,

119
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,136
this is also the first part of our brain

120
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,176
that goes offline
when we get stressed out,

121
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,456
which isn't that helpful.

122
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,957
Now, we can all relate to this
in our own experience.

123
00:05:16,981 --> 00:05:20,136
We're much more likely to do things
like yell at our spouse or kids

124
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,776
when we're stressed out or tired,

125
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,136
even though we know
it's not going to be helpful.

126
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,680
We just can't help ourselves.

127
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,296
When the prefrontal cortex goes offline,

128
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,536
we fall back into our old habits,

129
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,416
which is why this disenchantment
is so important.

130
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,096
Seeing what we get from our habits

131
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,296
helps us understand them
at a deeper level --

132
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,576
to know it in our bones

133
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,856
so we don't have to force
ourselves to hold back

134
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,616
or restrain ourselves from behavior.

135
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,416
We're just less interested
in doing it in the first place.

136
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,976
And this is what mindfulness is all about:

137
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,680
Seeing really clearly what we get
when we get caught up in our behaviors,

138
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,136
becoming disenchanted on a visceral level

139
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,280
and from this disenchanted stance,
naturally letting go.

140
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,416
This isn't to say that, poof,
magically we quit smoking.

141
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,056
But over time, as we learn
to see more and more clearly

142
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,416
the results of our actions,

143
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,080
we let go of old habits and form new ones.

144
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,456
The paradox here

145
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,296
is that mindfulness is just
about being really interested

146
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,736
in getting close and personal

147
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,336
with what's actually happening
in our bodies and minds

148
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,976
from moment to moment.

149
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,296
This willingness
to turn toward our experience

150
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:28,000
rather than trying to make unpleasant
cravings go away as quickly as possible.

151
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,336
And this willingness
to turn toward our experience

152
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,216
is supported by curiosity,

153
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,976
which is naturally rewarding.

154
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,736
What does curiosity feel like?

155
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,960
It feels good.

156
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,346
And what happens when we get curious?

157
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:44,816
We start to notice that cravings
are simply made up of body sensations --

158
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,096
oh, there's tightness, there's tension,

159
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,776
there's restlessness --

160
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,240
and that these body
sensations come and go.

161
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,856
These are bite-size pieces of experiences

162
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,896
that we can manage from moment to moment

163
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:01,056
rather than getting clobbered
by this huge, scary craving

164
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,456
that we choke on.

165
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,976
In other words, when we get curious,

166
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,736
we step out of our old,
fear-based, reactive habit patterns,

167
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,976
and we step into being.

168
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,896
We become this inner scientist

169
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:18,136
where we're eagerly awaiting
that next data point.

170
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,696
Now, this might sound
too simplistic to affect behavior.

171
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,176
But in one study,
we found that mindfulness training

172
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:29,096
was twice as good as gold standard therapy
at helping people quit smoking.

173
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,560
So it actually works.

174
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,616
And when we studied
the brains of experienced meditators,

175
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,456
we found that parts of a neural network
of self-referential processing

176
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,056
called the default mode network

177
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,296
were at play.

178
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,256
Now, one current hypothesis
is that a region of this network,

179
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,496
called the posterior cingulate cortex,

180
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,256
is activated not necessarily
by craving itself

181
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,896
but when we get caught up in it,
when we get sucked in,

182
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,616
and it takes us for a ride.

183
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,736
In contrast, when we let go --

184
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,136
step out of the process

185
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,656
just by being curiously aware
of what's happening --

186
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,800
this same brain region quiets down.

187
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:07,416
Now we're testing app and online-based
mindfulness training programs

188
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,576
that target these core mechanisms

189
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:15,096
and, ironically, use the same technology
that's driving us to distraction

190
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,656
to help us step out
of our unhealthy habit patterns

191
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,696
of smoking, of stress eating
and other addictive behaviors.

192
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,296
Now, remember that bit
about context-dependent memory?

193
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,216
We can deliver these tools
to peoples' fingertips

194
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,496
in the contexts that matter most.

195
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,736
So we can help them

196
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,736
tap into their inherent capacity
to be curiously aware

197
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,680
right when that urge to smoke
or stress eat or whatever arises.

198
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,456
So if you don't smoke or stress eat,

199
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:44,135
maybe the next time you feel this urge
to check your email when you're bored,

200
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,399
or you're trying to distract
yourself from work,

201
00:08:46,423 --> 00:08:50,222
or maybe to compulsively respond
to that text message when you're driving,

202
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,936
see if you can tap into
this natural capacity,

203
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,216
just be curiously aware

204
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,176
of what's happening in your body
and mind in that moment.

205
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,656
It will just be another chance

206
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:04,336
to perpetuate one of our endless
and exhaustive habit loops ...

207
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,600
or step out of it.

208
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,976
Instead of see text message,
compulsively text back,

209
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,736
feel a little bit better --

210
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,216
notice the urge,

211
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,696
get curious,

212
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,656
feel the joy of letting go

213
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,880
and repeat.

214
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,656
Thank you.

215
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,040
(Applause)
