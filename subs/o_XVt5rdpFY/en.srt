1
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,656
I love learning foreign languages.

2
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,736
In fact, I love it so much that I like
to learn a new language every two years,

3
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,856
currently working on my eighth one.

4
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,496
When people find that out about me,
they always ask me,

5
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,616
"How do you do that? What's your secret?"

6
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,656
And to be honest, for many years,
my answer would be,

7
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,000
"I don't know. I simply
love learning languages."

8
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,976
But people were never
happy with that answer.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,976
They wanted to know why they are spending
years trying to learn even one language,

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,536
never achieving fluency,

11
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,616
and here I come, learning
one language after another.

12
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,856
They wanted to know
the secret of polyglots,

13
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,600
people who speak a lot of languages.

14
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,816
And that made me wonder, too,

15
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,136
how do actually other polyglots do it?

16
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,656
What do we have in common?

17
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,616
And what is it that enables us

18
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,080
to learn languages
so much faster than other people?

19
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,720
I decided to meet other people
like me and find that out.

20
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,816
The best place to meet a lot of polyglots

21
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,136
is an event where hundreds
of language lovers

22
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,016
meet in one place
to practice their languages.

23
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,336
There are several such polyglot events
organized all around the world,

24
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,736
and so I decided to go there

25
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,200
and ask polyglots
about the methods that they use.

26
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,136
And so I met Benny from Ireland,

27
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:25,320
who told me that his method
is to start speaking from day one.

28
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,136
He learns a few phrases
from a travel phrasebook

29
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,736
and goes to meet native speakers

30
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,576
and starts having conversations
with them right away.

31
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,376
He doesn't mind making
even 200 mistakes a day,

32
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,840
because that's how he learns,
based on the feedback.

33
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,616
And the best thing is, he doesn't
even need to travel a lot today,

34
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,576
because you can easily have
conversations with native speakers

35
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,296
from the comfort of
your living room, using websites.

36
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,096
I also met Lucas from Brazil

37
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,600
who had a really interesting
method to learn Russian.

38
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,856
He simply added a hundred random
Russian speakers on Skype as friends,

39
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,776
and then he opened
a chat window with one of them

40
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,240
and wrote "Hi" in Russian.

41
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,576
And the person replied, "Hi, how are you?"

42
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,056
Lucas copied this and put it
into a text window with another person,

43
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,656
and the person replied,
"I'm fine, thank you, and how are you?"

44
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,656
Lucas copied this
back to the first person,

45
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,136
and in this way, he had two strangers
have a conversation with each other

46
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,576
without knowing about it.

47
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,856
(Laughter)

48
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,776
And soon he would start typing himself,

49
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,936
because he had so many
of these conversations

50
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,976
that he figured out how
the Russian conversation usually starts.

51
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,336
What an ingenious method, right?

52
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:38,856
And then I met polyglots who always start
by imitating sounds of the language,

53
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:43,296
and others who always learn the 500
most frequent words of the language,

54
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,720
and yet others who always start
by reading about the grammar.

55
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,896
If I asked a hundred different polyglots,

56
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,536
I heard a hundred different
approaches to learning languages.

57
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,176
Everybody seems to have a unique way
they learn a language,

58
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,080
and yet we all come to the same result
of speaking several languages fluently.

59
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,416
And as I was listening to these polyglots
telling me about their methods,

60
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,736
it suddenly dawned on me:

61
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,896
the one thing we all have in common

62
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:17,456
is that we simply found ways to enjoy
the language-learning process.

63
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,256
All of these polyglots
were talking about language learning

64
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,536
as if it was great fun.

65
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,136
You should have seen their faces

66
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,776
when they were showing me
their colorful grammar charts

67
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,296
and their carefully handmade flash cards,

68
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,336
and their statistics
about learning vocabulary using apps,

69
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,560
or even how they love to cook
based on recipes in a foreign language.

70
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,416
All of them use different methods,

71
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,216
but they always make sure
it's something that they personally enjoy.

72
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,136
I realized that this is actually
how I learn languages myself.

73
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,736
When I was learning Spanish,
I was bored with the text in the textbook.

74
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,496
I mean, who wants to read about Jose

75
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,656
asking about the directions
to the train station. Right?

76
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,016
I wanted to read "Harry Potter" instead,

77
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,176
because that was
my favorite book as a child,

78
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,856
and I have read it many times.

79
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,496
So I got the Spanish translation
of "Harry Potter" and started reading,

80
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,856
and sure enough, I didn't understand
almost anything at the beginning,

81
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,096
but I kept on reading
because I loved the book,

82
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:14,256
and by the end of the book, I was able
to follow it almost without any problems.

83
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,896
And the same thing happened
when I was learning German.

84
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,216
I decided to watch "Friends,"
my favorite sitcom, in German,

85
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,336
and again, at the beginning
it was all just gibberish.

86
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,536
I didn't know where one word finished
and another one started,

87
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,216
but I kept on watching every day
because it's "Friends."

88
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,616
I can watch it in any language.
I love it so much.

89
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,656
And after the second or third season,

90
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,040
seriously, the dialogue
started to make sense.

91
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,136
I only realized this
after meeting other polyglots.

92
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,736
We are no geniuses

93
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,176
and we have no shortcut
to learning languages.

94
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:48,016
We simply found ways
how to enjoy the process,

95
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,416
how to turn language learning
from a boring school subject

96
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,640
into a pleasant activity
which you don't mind doing every day.

97
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,696
If you don't like writing
words down on paper,

98
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,416
you can always type them in an app.

99
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,256
If you don't like listening
to boring textbook material,

100
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,576
find interesting content on YouTube
or in podcasts for any language.

101
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,296
If you're a more introverted person

102
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,336
and you can't imagine speaking
to native speakers right away,

103
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,696
you can apply the method of self-talk.

104
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,296
You can talk to yourself
in the comfort of your room,

105
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,216
describing your plans for the weekend,
how your day has been,

106
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,376
or even take a random
picture from your phone

107
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,136
and describe the picture
to your imaginary friend.

108
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,656
This is how polyglots learn languages,

109
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,536
and the best news is,
it's available to anyone

110
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,240
who is willing to take the learning
into their own hands.

111
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,616
So meeting other polyglots
helped me realize

112
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,656
that it is really crucial
to find enjoyment

113
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,776
in the process of learning languages,

114
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,840
but also that joy in itself is not enough.

115
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,416
If you want to achieve fluency
in a foreign language,

116
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,920
you'll also need to apply
three more principles.

117
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,360
First of all, you'll need
effective methods.

118
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,576
If you try to memorize a list of words
for a test tomorrow,

119
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,976
the words will be stored
in your short-term memory

120
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,905
and you'll forget them after a few days.

121
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,336
If you, however,
want to keep words long term,

122
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,296
you need to revise them
in the course of a few days repeatedly

123
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,536
using the so-called space repetition.

124
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,816
You can use apps which are based
on this system such as Anki or Memrise,

125
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,176
or you can write lists of word
in a notebook using the Goldlist method,

126
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,896
which is also very popular
with many polyglots.

127
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,656
If you're not sure which methods are
effective and what is available out there,

128
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,696
just check out polyglots'
YouTube channels and websites

129
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,496
and get inspiration from them.

130
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,440
If it works for them,
it will most probably work for you too.

131
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,816
The third principle to follow

132
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,000
is to create a system in your learning.

133
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,936
We're all very busy and no one
really has time to learn a language today.

134
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:47,736
But we can create that time
if we just plan a bit ahead.

135
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:51,176
Can you wake up 15 minutes earlier
than you normally do?

136
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,496
That would be the perfect time
to revise some vocabulary.

137
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,256
Can you listen to a podcast
on your way to work while driving?

138
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,736
Well, that would be great
to get some listening experience.

139
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:05,216
There are so many things we can do
without even planning that extra time,

140
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,896
such as listening to podcasts
on our way to work

141
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,576
or doing our household chores.

142
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,896
The important thing is
to create a plan in the learning.

143
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,416
"I will practice speaking
every Tuesday and Thursday

144
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,496
with a friend for 20 minutes.

145
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,936
I will listen to a YouTube video
while having breakfast."

146
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,096
If you create a system in your learning,

147
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,016
you don't need to find that extra time,

148
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,480
because it will become
a part of your everyday life.

149
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:33,096
And finally, if you want to learn
a language fluently,

150
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,840
you need also a bit of patience.

151
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,336
It's not possible to learn
a language within two months,

152
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,256
but it's definitely possible to make
a visible improvement in two months,

153
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,016
if you learn in small chunks every day
in a way that you enjoy.

154
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,176
And there is nothing
that motivates us more

155
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,440
than our own success.

156
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,016
I vividly remember the moment

157
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,720
when I understood the first joke
in German when watching "Friends."

158
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,136
I was so happy and motivated

159
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,176
that I just kept on watching that day
two more episodes,

160
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,936
and as I kept watching,

161
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:08,176
I had more and more of those moments
of understanding, these little victories,

162
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,656
and step by step, I got to a level
where I could use the language

163
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,536
freely and fluently to express anything.

164
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,080
This is a wonderful feeling.

165
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,496
I can't get enough of that feeling,

166
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,336
and that's why I learn
a language every two years.

167
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,416
So this is the whole polyglot secret.

168
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,296
Find effective methods
which you can use systematically

169
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,616
over the period of some time
in a way which you enjoy,

170
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:33,520
and this is how polyglots learn
languages within months, not years.

171
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,776
Now, some of you may be thinking,

172
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,136
"That's all very nice
to enjoy language learning,

173
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,696
but isn't the real secret
that you polyglots

174
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,320
are just super talented
and most of us aren't?"

175
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,400
Well, there's one thing
I haven't told you about Benny and Lucas.

176
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:54,976
Benny had 11 years of Irish Gaelic
and five years of German at school.

177
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,216
He couldn't speak them
at all when graduating.

178
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,416
Up to the age of 21, he thought
he didn't have the language gene

179
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,856
and he could not speak another language.

180
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,816
Then he started to look
for his way of learning languages,

181
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,696
which was speaking to native speakers
and getting feedback from them,

182
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,680
and today Benny can easily
have a conversation in 10 languages.

183
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,416
Lucas tried to learn English
at school for 10 years.

184
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,056
He was one of the worst students in class.

185
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,696
His friends even made fun of him

186
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,336
and gave him a Russian textbook as a joke

187
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,096
because they thought he would never
learn that language, or any language.

188
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,496
And then Lucas started
to experiment with methods,

189
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,320
looking for his own way to learn,

190
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:40,696
for example, by having Skype chat
conversations with strangers.

191
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,536
And after just 10 years,

192
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,880
Lucas is able to speak
11 languages fluently.

193
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,560
Does that sound like a miracle?

194
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,040
Well, I see such miracles
every single day.

195
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,096
As a language mentor,

196
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,536
I help people learn
languages by themselves,

197
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,856
and I see this every day.

198
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:02,056
People struggle with language learning
for five, 10, even 20 years,

199
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,936
and then they suddenly take
their learning into their own hands,

200
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:09,256
start using materials which they enjoy,
more effective methods,

201
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,096
or they start tracking their learning

202
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,056
so that they can appreciate
their own progress,

203
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,016
and that's when suddenly

204
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:20,240
they magically find the language talent
that they were missing all their lives.

205
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,656
So if you've also tried
to learn a language

206
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,096
and you gave up,
thinking it's too difficult

207
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,376
or you don't have the language talent,

208
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,936
give it another try.

209
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,816
Maybe you're also
just one enjoyable method away

210
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,602
from learning that language fluently.

211
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:38,896
Maybe you're just one method away
from becoming a polyglot.

212
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,136
Thank you.

213
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,360
(Applause)
