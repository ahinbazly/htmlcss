1
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:17,136
What if I told you there was something
that you can do right now

2
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,856
that would have an immediate,
positive benefit for your brain

3
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,560
including your mood and your focus?

4
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,616
And what if I told you that same thing
could actually last a long time

5
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,296
and protect your brain
from different conditions

6
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,256
like depression,
Alzheimer's disease or dementia.

7
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,936
Would you do it?

8
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,176
Yes!

9
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,696
I am talking about the powerful effects
of physical activity.

10
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,136
Simply moving your body,

11
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:51,400
has immediate, long-lasting
and protective benefits for your brain.

12
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,136
And that can last
for the rest of your life.

13
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,536
So what I want to do today
is tell you a story

14
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:01,176
about how I used my deep
understanding of neuroscience,

15
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,936
as a professor of neuroscience,

16
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,776
to essentially do an experiment on myself

17
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,816
in which I discovered
the science underlying

18
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,696
why exercise
is the most transformative thing

19
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,720
that you can do for your brain today.

20
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,056
Now, as a neuroscientist,
I know that our brains,

21
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,136
that is the thing in our head right now,

22
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:27,256
that is the most complex structure
known to humankind.

23
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,936
But it's one thing
to talk about the brain,

24
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,400
and it's another to see it.

25
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,736
So here is a real preserved human brain.

26
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:38,616
And it's going to illustrate two key areas
that we are going to talk about today.

27
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,896
The first is the prefrontal cortex,
right behind your forehead,

28
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:48,800
critical for things like decision-making,
focus, attention and your personality.

29
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,616
The second key area is located
in the temporal lobe, shown right here.

30
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,776
You have two temporal lobes in your brain,
the right and the left,

31
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,416
and deep in the temporal lobe
is a key structure

32
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,136
critical for your ability

33
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:05,616
to form and retain new long-term
memories for facts and events.

34
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,776
And that structure
is called the hippocampus.

35
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,160
So I've always been fascinated
with the hippocampus.

36
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,456
How could it be that an event
that lasts just a moment,

37
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,696
say, your first kiss,

38
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,176
or the moment your first child was born,

39
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,256
can form a memory
that has changed your brain,

40
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,616
that lasts an entire lifetime?

41
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,656
That's what I want to understand.

42
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:35,776
I wanted to start and record
the activity of individual brain cells

43
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,416
in the hippocampus

44
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,616
as subjects were forming new memories.

45
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:44,936
And essentially try and decode how
those brief bursts of electrical activity,

46
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,896
which is how neurons
communicate with each other,

47
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,520
how those brief bursts either allowed us
to form a new memory, or did not.

48
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,296
But a few years ago,
I did something very unusual in science.

49
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,456
As a full professor of neural science,

50
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,280
I decided to completely switch
my research program.

51
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,136
Because I encountered something
that was so amazing,

52
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,216
with the potential to change so many lives

53
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,496
that I had to study it.

54
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:18,336
I discovered and I experienced
the brain-changing effects of exercise.

55
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,536
And I did it in a completely
inadvertent way.

56
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,376
I was actually at the height
of all the memory work that I was doing --

57
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,016
data was pouring in,

58
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,576
I was becoming known in my field
for all of this memory work.

59
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,200
And it should have been going great.
It was, scientifically.

60
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,656
But when I stuck my head
out of my lab door,

61
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,920
I noticed something.

62
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,376
I had no social life.

63
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,136
I spent too much time
listening to those brain cells

64
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,736
in a dark room, by myself.

65
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,896
(Laughter)

66
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,536
I didn't move my body at all.

67
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,296
I had gained 25 pounds.

68
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,136
And actually, it took me
many years to realize it,

69
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,616
I was actually miserable.

70
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,336
And I shouldn't be miserable.

71
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,816
And I went on a river-rafting trip --
by myself, because I had no social life.

72
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,096
And I came back --

73
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,136
(Laughter)

74
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,616
thinking, "Oh, my God,
I was the weakest person on that trip."

75
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,176
And I came back with a mission.

76
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,856
I said, "I'm never going to feel
like the weakest person

77
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,376
on a river-rafting trip again."

78
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,376
And that's what made me go to the gym.

79
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,896
And I focused my type-A personality

80
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,856
on going to all the exercise
classes at the gym.

81
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,776
I tried everything.

82
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,736
I went to kickbox,
dance, yoga, step class,

83
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,896
and at first it was really hard.

84
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:37,896
But what I noticed is that after every
sweat-inducing workout that I tried,

85
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,816
I had this great mood boost
and this great energy boost.

86
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,576
And that's what kept me
going back to the gym.

87
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,176
Well, I started feeling stronger.

88
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,816
I started feeling better,
I even lost that 25 pounds.

89
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:55,840
And now, fast-forward a year and a half
into this regular exercise program

90
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,016
and I noticed something that really
made me sit up and take notice.

91
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,016
I was sitting at my desk,
writing a research grant,

92
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,096
and a thought went through my mind

93
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,776
that had never gone
through my mind before.

94
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,656
And that thought was,

95
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,976
"Gee, grant-writing is going well today."

96
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,296
And all the scientists --

97
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,336
(Laughter)

98
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,936
yeah, all the scientists
always laugh when I say that,

99
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,976
because grant-writing never goes well.

100
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,816
It is so hard; you're always
pulling your hair out,

101
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,096
trying to come up with that
million-dollar-winning idea.

102
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,376
But I realized that
the grant-writing was going well,

103
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,736
because I was able
to focus and maintain my attention

104
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,776
for longer than I had before.

105
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:40,776
And my long-term memory --
what I was studying in my own lab --

106
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,640
seemed to be better in me.

107
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,616
And that's when I put it together.

108
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:50,856
Maybe all that exercise
that I had included and added to my life

109
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,096
was changing my brain.

110
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,136
Maybe I did an experiment on myself
without even knowing it.

111
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,776
So as a curious neuroscientist,

112
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,496
I went to the literature to see
what I could find about what we knew

113
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,616
about the effects
of exercise on the brain.

114
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:06,776
And what I found was an exciting
and a growing literature

115
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,976
that was essentially showing everything
that I noticed in myself.

116
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,960
Better mood, better energy,
better memory, better attention.

117
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,776
And the more I learned,

118
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,176
the more I realized
how powerful exercise was.

119
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,376
Which eventually
led me to the big decision

120
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,136
to completely shift my research focus.

121
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:33,056
And so now, after several years
of really focusing on this question,

122
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,976
I've come to the following conclusion:

123
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,496
that exercise is
the most transformative thing

124
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,776
that you can do for your brain today

125
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,896
for the following three reasons.

126
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,696
Number one: it has
immediate effects on your brain.

127
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,736
A single workout that you do

128
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:53,376
will immediately increase
levels of neurotransmitters

129
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,936
like dopamine, serotonin
and noradrenaline.

130
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,216
That is going to increase your mood
right after that workout,

131
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,816
exactly what I was feeling.

132
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,296
My lab showed that a single workout

133
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,896
can improve your ability
to shift and focus attention,

134
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,856
and that focus improvement
will last for at least two hours.

135
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,496
And finally, studies have shown

136
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,896
that a single workout
will improve your reaction times

137
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,176
which basically means

138
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,536
that you are going to be faster
at catching that cup of Starbucks

139
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,296
that falls off the counter,

140
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,056
which is very, very important.

141
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,096
(Laughter)

142
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,040
But these immediate effects are transient,
they help you right after.

143
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,536
What you have to do is do what I did,

144
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,576
that is change your exercise regime,
increase your cardiorespiratory function,

145
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,936
to get the long-lasting effects.

146
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,216
And these effects are long-lasting

147
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:45,656
because exercise actually
changes the brain's anatomy,

148
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,680
physiology and function.

149
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,600
Let's start with my favorite
brain area, the hippocampus.

150
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,736
The hippocampus --

151
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:58,216
or exercise actually
produces brand new brain cells,

152
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,896
new brain cells in the hippocampus,
that actually increase its volume,

153
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:07,256
as well as improve
your long-term memory, OK?

154
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,720
And that including in you and me.

155
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,016
Number two: the most common finding
in neuroscience studies,

156
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,656
looking at effects of long-term exercise,

157
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:21,056
is improved attention function
dependent on your prefrontal cortex.

158
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,536
You not only get
better focus and attention,

159
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,136
but the volume of the hippocampus
increases as well.

160
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:32,136
And finally, you not only get
immediate effects of mood with exercise

161
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,816
but those last for a long time.

162
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:39,200
So you get long-lasting increases
in those good mood neurotransmitters.

163
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:44,496
But really, the most transformative thing
that exercise will do

164
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,696
is its protective effects on your brain.

165
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,576
Here you can think
about the brain like a muscle.

166
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,256
The more you're working out,

167
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:57,120
the bigger and stronger your hippocampus
and prefrontal cortex gets.

168
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,936
Why is that important?

169
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,736
Because the prefrontal cortex
and the hippocampus

170
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:07,536
are the two areas that are most
susceptible to neurodegenerative diseases

171
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,480
and normal cognitive decline in aging.

172
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:14,136
So with increased exercise
over your lifetime,

173
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,296
you're not going to cure
dementia or Alzheimer's disease,

174
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,816
but what you're going to do
is you're going to create

175
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,496
the strongest, biggest hippocampus
and prefrontal cortex

176
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:26,960
so it takes longer for these diseases
to actually have an effect.

177
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,336
You can think of exercise, therefore,

178
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:35,776
as a supercharged 401K for your brain, OK?

179
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,680
And it's even better, because it's free.

180
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,776
So this is the point in the talk
where everybody says,

181
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,936
"That sounds so interesting, Wendy,

182
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,496
but I really will only
want to know one thing.

183
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:51,416
And that is, just tell me
the minimum amount of exercise

184
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,296
I need to get all these changes."

185
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,336
(Laughter)

186
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,176
And so I'm going to tell you
the answer to that question.

187
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,496
First, good news: you don't have to become
a triathlete to get these effects.

188
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:06,056
The rule of thumb is you want to get
three to four times a week exercise

189
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,496
minimum 30 minutes an exercise session,

190
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,176
and you want to get aerobic exercise in.

191
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,176
That is, get your heart rate up.

192
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,696
And the good news is,
you don't have to go to the gym

193
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,736
to get a very expensive gym membership.

194
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:22,456
Add an extra walk around the block
in your power walk.

195
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,936
You see stairs -- take stairs.

196
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:29,056
And power-vacuuming can be as good
as the aerobics class

197
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,960
that you were going to take at the gym.

198
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,856
So I've gone from memory pioneer

199
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,656
to exercise explorer.

200
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,496
From going into the innermost
workings of the brain,

201
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:45,736
to trying to understand how exercise
can improve our brain function,

202
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,576
and my goal in my lab right now

203
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,736
is to go beyond that rule of thumb
that I just gave you --

204
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,656
three to four times a week, 30 minutes.

205
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,896
I want to understand
the optimum exercise prescription

206
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,896
for you, at your age,
at your fitness level,

207
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,816
for your genetic background,

208
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:08,616
to maximize the effects of exercise today

209
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:13,936
and also to improve your brain
and protect your brain the best

210
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,736
for the rest of your life.

211
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,816
But it's one thing to talk about exercise,
and it's another to do it.

212
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:23,576
So I'm going to invoke my power
as a certified exercise instructor,

213
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,176
to ask you all to stand up.

214
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,056
(Laughter)

215
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,336
We're going to do
just one minute of exercise.

216
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,856
It's call-and-response,
just do what I do, say what I say,

217
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,016
and make sure you don't punch
your neighbor, OK?

218
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,256
Music!

219
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,896
(Upbeat music)

220
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:43,416
Five, six, seven, eight,
it's right, left, right, left.

221
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,136
And I say, I am strong now.

222
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,376
Let's hear you.

223
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,416
Audience: I am strong now.

224
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:56,096
Wendy Suzuki: Ladies,
I am Wonder Woman-strong.

225
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,336
Let's hear you!

226
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,256
Audience: I am Wonder Woman-strong.

227
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,896
WS: New move -- uppercut, right and left.

228
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,816
I am inspired now. You say it!

229
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:10,176
Audience: I am inspired now.

230
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,096
WS: Last move -- pull it down,
right and left, right and left.

231
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:18,896
I say, I am on fire now! You say it.

232
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,216
Audience: I am on fire now.

233
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,736
WS: And done! OK, good job!

234
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:29,976
(Applause)

235
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,616
Thank you.

236
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,416
I want to leave you with one last thought.

237
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,896
And that is, bringing
exercise in your life

238
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,896
will not only give you
a happier, more protective life today,

239
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:47,496
but it will protect your brain
from incurable diseases.

240
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:52,656
And in this way it will change
the trajectory of your life

241
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,896
for the better.

242
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,136
Thank you very much.

243
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,416
(Applause)

244
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,656
Thank you.

245
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,880
(Applause)
